<div id="header"><h5>SPORTS</h5>
    
    
    <p>Sports is what I would say is my personal favourite group of hobbies. I have been participaiting in organised sports since the age of 3 or 4, and have explored many different types over the years. </p>
    
    
    <p>Currently, my main sport is basketball. I play for both club (Tuakau Bullets) and School, and have been playing seriously for the higher end of 2 years. My secondary sports are Track (running), Badminton,  Mixed Martial Arts (predominantly boxing), Volleyball, High-Jump, and Darts.</p>
    </div>
    
    
<div id="sidebar"><h5>MUSIC</h5>
    
    
   <p> If anything comes close to sports, it's music. I have been interested in music since a young age and as of now can proficiently play the drums and ukulele, as well as many drum variants. Instruments I can play, but not-as-well as the others include the recorder, guitar, keyboard, and the bass guitar.</p>
    
    
   <p> In regards to musical interests and what I enjoy listening to, my palette is vast. 
    A few of my favourite artists include Kendrick Lamar, XXXtentacion, Brent Faiyaz and Lauryn Hill. I listen to various genres such as Hip-Hop, Rap, Classical, Jazz, Rock, RnB, etc. I enjoy thought-provoking and relatable music, as well as music that is enjoyable and catchy.</p>

<div id="main"><h5>OTHER</h5>
    
<p>My other interests include that of reading, watching anime/reading manga, cooking, going to the gym, singing and dancing, gaming, learning languages, and spending quality time with people.</p>
