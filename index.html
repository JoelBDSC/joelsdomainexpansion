<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
<div></div>  
     
                                        <h4>Past (Birth-Primary)</h4>        
        <p> My name is Joel Atotwe Fumbilwa, born February 19th 2010 in Golflands, New Zealand. I was born to 2 Zambian-born parents who at the time had been living in New Zealand for 9 years; making me a first-generation child in this country. I have two older siblings, Abigail and Nathaniel who are 22 and 18 respectively. I began attending a kindergarten across the road from the Birthing centre I was born in named ABC (now called BestStart), from February 2013 to December 2014. I then began attending Botany Downs Primary School as a Year 1 in 2015 when I turned 5, joining my brother who was a year 5. I attended BDPS all the way until 2020 when I was 10. I graduated primary school with a good academic track record, recieving extracurricular accolades such as Interschool cross-country invites, 2 first-places  in cross country,4 top-10 placements,  being a part of the bucket drumming group, K-pop dance group, Ukulele group, and many others. I have always had a passion for running since I was young, and I picked up hobbies such as drumming, dancing, and ukulele/recorder between the ages of 6-9. I also began looking into Japanese culture in my 2020 graduate year. </p>

                                            <h4>Past (Intermediate)</h4>    
           <p>From there, I was accepted into Somerville Intermediate which I                                 attended from 2021-2022. In my time at Somerville, I began to excel in many academic fields such as literacy, mathematics, and science. I brought my drumming talent into the school rock band, where I had the opportunity to attend a public event where I performed infront of close                     to 1,000 people in a reigonal competition. Alongside this, I was in the premier basketball team and other service co-curriculars. I graduated in 2022 as a top 100 student in my class.</p>

                                            <h4>Current (Highschool)</h4>      
             <p>After Somerville takes me to Botany Downs Secondary college, where I am now attending as a Year 10 student taking Japanese, Investigative Geography and Digital technologies. Throughout my highschool experience so far, I have been highly involved in sports, playing basketball and running track both in and out of school, and also taking part in many maths competitions and committees and councils. In my first year of highschool, I began to see a strength in my mathematic ability and saw another increase of performance in that field since intermediate. I began pursuing more knowledge and studying it, leading to me being admitted into the accelerant maths programme this year. I have also made strides in English, Science, and Social Studies; earning excellences in all of those for my EOY exams and throughout the course of 2023 and 2024.</p>
        
    <div></div>  
    
<h4>Future Aspirations</h4>  
<p> Going forwards in my career, I mainly hope to pursue something in the field of sports, followed by Business, Digital Technologies, Theology/Philosophy, Physical Health get or music.  I hope to be able to  get admitted into a College overseas to pursue my career after/during highschool and study to get a degree and possibly PHd in my chosen profession. </p>
